# CS-223-Lab-3-
This is a lab assignment given by Bilkent University in the CS 223 Digital Design Course.

Behavioral SystemVerilog module for 2-to-1 multiplexer and a testbench for it.
Behavioral SystemVerilog module for 4-to-1 multiplexer by using three 2-to-1 multiplexers and a testbench for it.
Behavioral SystemVerilog module for the function g given in the lab document using a 2-to-1 multiplexer and a testbench for simulation.
Structural SystemVerilog module for 3-to-8 decoder using 2-to-4 decoders you implemented in the previous part and a testbench for it.
SystemVerilog module for F(A,B,C,D,E)=âˆ‘(1,2,7,10,16,17,18,19,21,26,29,30) function using one (not two) 8-to-1 multiplexer and one 2-to-4 decoder. The design contains only one 8-to-1 multiplexer and one 2-to-4 decoder.
